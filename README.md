## Hello 👋🏻!

I'm Serhii, a software engineering leader based in London, originally from Ukraine. This page is a short introduction to who I am and what I do.

## My Story
I'm from [Hadiach](https://goo.gl/maps/FM6Pc3h8erwBUKUj7), a small town in central-eastern Ukraine. After graduating from Mykhailo Drahomanov Humanitarian Lyceum in 2010, I moved to Kyiv, where I completed both a minor and a major in applied mathematics at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (2016).

I began my career in technology in 2015. What started as web development gradually evolved into a deeper focus on system design, architecture, and engineering management. Over the past decade, I've designed solutions across telecom and healthcare, working as closely with people as with code. I've learned how to identify the right engineering talent for a business and how to support people in meeting ambitious goals.

In 2020, I relocated to London to help build [C the Signs](https://cthesigns.co.uk), a healthcare technology company, while also strengthening ties with engineering talent in Ukraine. That's the path I'm still on today.

Below you'll find work related to my professional focus, along with a few things that fall outside it.


## Tech Writing

I used to contribute to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2852528/serhii-povisenko). Working as a software engineer, I've come to believe that staying sharp correlates with whether you write code regularly. Stack Overflow taught me a great deal, and it's a community I value giving back to—though these days I only contribute occasionally. I've also written for other publications in the past; those pieces are listed below:
- Java Memory Consumption in Docker and How We Employed Spring Boot. [link](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-decrease-jvm-memory-consumption-in-docker-u)
- How to Extend Your AWS Infrastructure with Direct Connect Using Terraform. [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-extend-your-aws-infrastructure/)
- COM Interface API Tutorial: Java Spring Boot + JACOB Library. [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/interface-in-java-tutorial-how-to-call-the-com-interface-spring-boot-jacob-library/)

## Other Things

- In 2022, I started a [Substack](https://povisenko.substack.com) where I write about topics I'm curious about and reflect on the world. There's no particular theme yet—too little has been written—but I'm motivated to keep going. It's a hobby I take seriously. I write in both Ukrainian and English.
- [Diaspora XX](https://soundcloud.com/diasporaxx) is a hobby project exploring Ukrainian diaspora music from the 20th century, up to 1991. Moving to London opened my eyes to something I hadn't known about: the ease of finding old Ukrainian vinyl released across the world during that era. You can browse the collection on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/povisenko/collection).
- I try to provide ongoing support to friends serving in the Ukrainian Defence Forces—organising fundraisers and buying what they need. Financial reports are available [here](https://linktr.ee/povisenko) and on my social media.
- Sometimes I play awkward electronic music with my friends and have fun.
