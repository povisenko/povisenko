### Hello Friends!

It's my GitHub profile README, the place where I will keep up-to-date information about myself that I'd like to be public.

## My Background

üé¨ I am from Hadiach. Born in the year 1994. Citizen of Ukraine üá∫üá¶.

üéì After I finished middle school, at Mykhailo Drahomanov Humanitarian Lyceum, in 2010 I moved to Kyiv. There I studied mathematics and computer science at Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, where I got my Masters's Degree in Applied Mathematics (2016)

üìà In 2015 I began my professional career in Information Technology. Gradually my proficiency in web development grew and I gravitated towards doing system design, architecture and engineering management. Today it is the career path I am on.

üìç In 2020 I moved to London where I reside now.

üí° I am curious about many things, and honestly speaking, knowledge is my only true passion and thirst. Below you could find the list of things that I did and do.

## My Web Trace

* In 2022, I started my [Substack](https://povisenko.substack.com). Here I write about topics I am curious and reflect about the world. Though I could not highlight a particular theme yet as too little was written so far, but I am highly motivated to write more, it is indeed one of my ongoing hobbies I treat with utmost seriousness. I wrote only in Ukrainian, nevertheless my plan is to create texts in English too. 

* I am active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2852528/serhii-povisenko). Doing software engineering professionally, I believe the degree of that professionalism correlates with the fact, whether you write the code or not. Stack Overflow, it's the place that I learned from a lot. And this is the community I like to contribute to. Though in the past I wrote a few pages on different software engineering topics, nowadays, as a tech writer, I only contribute to Stack Overflow. The pages I wrote bofore will leaving here as a sublist:
  * [Java Memory Consumption in Docker and How We Employed Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-decrease-jvm-memory-consumption-in-docker-u)
  * [Running Java on AWS Infrastructure: How To Put the Bricks Together](https://dzone.com/articles/architecture-for-your-startup-or-how-to-put-sticks)
  * [How to Extend Your AWS Infrastructure with Direct Connect Using Terraform](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-extend-your-aws-infrastructure/)
  * [COM Interface API Tutorial: Java Spring Boot + JACOB Library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/interface-in-java-tutorial-how-to-call-the-com-interface-spring-boot-jacob-library/)

- [Diaspora XX](https://soundcloud.com/diasporaxx). It is a non-commercial educational project where I explore the Ukrainian diaspora musical heritage of the XX century up to 1991. Me moving to London opened a lot of things for me that I was not aware of before. And one such thing is access to old Ukrainian vinyl released across the world in the XX century. The collection you could brows on my [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/povisenko/collection).
