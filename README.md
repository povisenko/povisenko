### Hello 👋🏻!

It's my GitHub profile README, the place where I will keep information about myself that I'd like to be public.

## Background

🎬 I am from Hadiach. Born in the year 1994. Citizen of Ukraine 🇺🇦.

🎓 After I finished middle school, at Mykhailo Drahomanov Humanitarian Lyceum, in 2010 I moved to Kyiv. There I studied mathematics and computer science at Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, where I got my Masters's Degree in Applied Mathematics (2016)

📈 In 2015 I began my professional career in Information Technology. Gradually my proficiency in web development grew and I gravitated towards doing system design, architecture and engineering management. Today it is the career path I am on.

📍 In 2020 I moved to London where I reside now.

💡 I am curious about many things, and honestly speaking, knowledge is my only true passion and thirst. Below you could find the list of things that I did and do.

## My Web Trace

- In 2022, I started my [Substack](https://povisenko.substack.com). Here I write about topics I am curious and reflect about the world. Though I could not highlight a particular theme yet as too little was written so far, but I am highly motivated to write more, it is indeed one of my ongoing hobbies I treat with utmost seriousness. I wrote only in Ukrainian, nevertheless my plan is to create texts in English too. 

- I am active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2852528/serhii-povisenko). Doing software engineering professionally, I believe the degree of that professionalism correlates with the fact, whether you write the code or not. Stack Overflow, it's the place that I learned from a lot. And this is the community I like to contribute to. 

- [Diaspora XX](https://soundcloud.com/diasporaxx). It is a non-commercial educational project where I explore the Ukrainian diaspora musical heritage of the XX century up to 1991. Me moving to London opened a lot of things for me that I was not aware of before. And one such thing is access to old Ukrainian vinyl released across the world in the XX century. The collection you could brows on my [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/povisenko/collection).
