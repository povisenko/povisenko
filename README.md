## Hello üëãüèª!

Here you'll find some concise information I'd like to share about myself.

## My Story

I am from [Hadiach](https://goo.gl/maps/FM6Pc3h8erwBUKUj7). After I finished my hometown middle school, at Mykhailo Drahomanov Humanitarian Lyceum, in 2010 I moved to Kyiv where I did minor and major in applied mathematics at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (2016).

In 2015 I began my professional career in Information Technology. Gradually my proficiency in web development grew while gravitating towards system design, architecture and engineering management. Over the past decade, I have designed multiple solutions for various businesses, mostly telecom and healthcare. I also work closely with people as well as with the code. I know how to hire the right engineering talents for a business and how to guide and support onboarded people to meet expectations through achiving key targets.

In 2020 I moved to London, to help build an ambitious healthcare tech [company](https://cthesigns.co.uk) on-site as well as promote and strengthen cooperation with engineering talents from Ukraine to facilitate reciprocal growth and development. Today it is the career path I am on.

Below you could find the list of things that I did related to my professional area or the ones that span beyond.

## Tech Writing

I am active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2852528/serhii-povisenko). Doing software engineering professionally, I became convinced that a degree of that professionalism correlates with the fact, whether you write the code regularly or not. Stack Overflow allowed me to learn a lot. And this is a community I'd like to contribute to. In the past I wrote a few pages on different software engineering topics to other blogs but nowadays, as a tech writer, I only contribute to Stack Overflow. The pages that I pubslihed apart I will leaving here as a sublist:
  * Java Memory Consumption in Docker and How We Employed Spring Boot. [link](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-decrease-jvm-memory-consumption-in-docker-u)
  * Running Java on AWS Infrastructure: How To Put the Bricks Together. [link](https://dzone.com/articles/architecture-for-your-startup-or-how-to-put-sticks)
  * How to Extend Your AWS Infrastructure with Direct Connect Using Terraform. [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-extend-your-aws-infrastructure/)
  * COM Interface API Tutorial: Java Spring Boot + JACOB Library. [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/interface-in-java-tutorial-how-to-call-the-com-interface-spring-boot-jacob-library/)

## Other Things

* In 2022 I started my [Substack](https://povisenko.substack.com). Here I write about topics I am curious about and do some reflections about the world. Though I could not highlight a particular theme yet as too little was written so far, I am highly motivated to write more, it is indeed one of my ongoing hobbies I treat with utmost seriousness. I write both in Ukrainian and English. 

* [Diaspora XX](https://soundcloud.com/diasporaxx). It is a hobby project where I explore the Ukrainian diaspora musical heritage of the XX century up to 1991. Moving to London opened a lot of things for me that I was not aware of before. And one such thing is access to buy easily old Ukrainian vinyls released across the world in the XX century. You could brows the collection on my [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/povisenko/collection).
