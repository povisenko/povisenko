### Welcome!

Bellow on that page, you'll find all the up-to-date information I'd like to share about myself.

## Background

I am from [Hadiach](https://goo.gl/maps/FM6Pc3h8erwBUKUj7). Born in the year 1994. Citizen of Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.

After I finished my hometown middle school, at Mykhailo Drahomanov Humanitarian Lyceum, in 2010 I moved to Kyiv. Received a master's degree in applied mathematics (2016) after studying at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.

In 2015 I began my professional career in Information Technology. Gradually my proficiency in web development grew while gravitating towards system design, architecture and engineering management. Over the past decade, I have designed multiple solutions for various businesses, mostly telecom and healthcare. Also, I had a chance to work closely with teams: from hiring the right engineering talents for the business to guiding and assisting them.

In 2020 I moved to London, to help develop the healthcare tech [company](https://cthesigns.co.uk) on-site. Today it is the career path I am on.

Below you could find the list of things that I did or/and do both: related to my professional area and the ones that span beyond.

## Engagements

* In 2022, I started my [Substack](https://povisenko.substack.com). Here I write about topics I am curious and reflect about the world. Though I could not highlight a particular theme yet as too little was written so far, but I am highly motivated to write more, it is indeed one of my ongoing hobbies I treat with utmost seriousness. I wrote only in Ukrainian, nevertheless my plan is to create texts in English too. 

* I am active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2852528/serhii-povisenko). Doing software engineering professionally, I believe the degree of that professionalism correlates with the fact, whether you write the code or not. Stack Overflow, it's the place that I learned from a lot. And this is the community I like to contribute to. Though in the past I wrote a few pages on different software engineering topics, nowadays, as a tech writer, I only contribute to Stack Overflow. The pages I wrote bofore will leaving here as a sublist:
  * [Java Memory Consumption in Docker and How We Employed Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-decrease-jvm-memory-consumption-in-docker-u)
  * [Running Java on AWS Infrastructure: How To Put the Bricks Together](https://dzone.com/articles/architecture-for-your-startup-or-how-to-put-sticks)
  * [How to Extend Your AWS Infrastructure with Direct Connect Using Terraform](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-extend-your-aws-infrastructure/)
  * [COM Interface API Tutorial: Java Spring Boot + JACOB Library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/interface-in-java-tutorial-how-to-call-the-com-interface-spring-boot-jacob-library/)

* [Diaspora XX](https://soundcloud.com/diasporaxx). It is a non-commercial educational project where I explore the Ukrainian diaspora musical heritage of the XX century up to 1991. Me moving to London opened a lot of things for me that I was not aware of before. And one such thing is access to old Ukrainian vinyl released across the world in the XX century. The collection you could brows on my [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/povisenko/collection).

* Volunteer at Charity Fund ["Doing Acts Of Kindness Together"](https://youcontrol.com.ua/en/catalog/company_details/44798488/). Since the beginning of the full-scale russian invasion of my country, I joined my hometown charity organisation ["Ð Ð¾Ð±Ð¸Ð¼Ð¾ Ð”Ð¾Ð±Ñ€Ñ– Ð¡Ð¿Ñ€Ð°Ð²Ð¸ Ð Ð°Ð·Ð¾Ð¼"](https://www.instagram.com/dobri_spravy_hadiach/). I help to raise money, buy optics and different tactical equipment here in the UK and ship it to Ukraine. I do all that I can to support volunteers who are on-site to assist the Defence Forces of Ukraine in their utmost honoured task - the protection of the country, people including my family, from russian fascism.
